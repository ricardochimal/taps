= Taps -- simple database import/export app

A simple database agnostic import/export app to transfer data to/from a remote database.

== Usage: Server

Here's how you start a taps server

  $ taps server postgres://localdbuser:localdbpass@localhost/dbname httpuser httppassword

You can also specify an encoding in the database url

  $ taps server mysql://localdbuser:localdbpass@localhost/dbname?encoding=latin1 httpuser httppassword

== Usage: Client

When you want to pull down a database from a taps server

  $ taps pull postgres://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname http://httpuser:httppassword@example.com:5000

or when you want to push a local database to a taps server

  $ taps push postgres://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname http://httpuser:httppassword@example.com:5000

or when you want to transfer a list of tables

  $ taps push postgres://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname http://httpuser:httppassword@example.com:5000 --tables logs,tags

or when you want to transfer tables that start with a word

  $ taps push postgres://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname http://httpuser:httppassword@example.com:5000 --filter '^log_'
  
or when you want to transfer all tables except a list of given tables

$ taps push postgres://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname http://httpuser:httppassword@example.com:5000 --exclude_tables logs,tags


== Known Issues

* Foreign Keys get lost in the schema transfer
* Tables without primary keys will be incredibly slow to transfer. This is due to it being inefficient having large offset values in queries.
* Multiple schemas are currently not supported
